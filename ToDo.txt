ToDo:

- Check if a function exists to map the vcenter names to friendly names (not sure how)

- Ignore any manual desktop pools
- If a pool is disabled, set all values to some default


- create an additional version of the get pools function that uses "/inventory/v6/desktop-pools"
    - this includes CPU and Memory - not available until 2206
    - Instead, query Horizon version. If version >= 2206, leverage the v6 version of the API

- Add the vCenter Domain to the user credentials for vCenter auth (in case the domain isn't the default) - just do username+@+domain


- Figure out what happens if the account does not have permissions in one or more of the vCenter/Horizon Environments
