ToDo:

- What to do when a pool is disabled

- Check if a function exists to map the vcenter names to friendly names (not sure how)


- create an additional version of the get pools function that uses "/inventory/v6/desktop-pools"
    - this includes CPU and Memory - not available until 2206


- Add the vCenter Domain to the user credentials for vCenter auth (in case the domain isn't the default) - just do username+@+domain

- Think about what happens if multiple Horizon pods have the same vCenter
